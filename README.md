# School_District_Analysis
School District Analysis using Python, Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook.

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize math and reading scores at a school and school district level to measure performance.  Factors that weighed into the results were type of school, school spending and size of student population. Concerns were brought forward about Thomas High Schools 9th grade class and therefore those data points were removed in this analysis.
